##Team Evaluation
(b) Write a draft 500-word report that must:
i. identify two key teamwork skills that you consider weaknesses;
ii. assess your application of each of these skills, describing how they
affected your work and suggesting why they arose;
iii. and then identify how to improve each of these skills, with reference
to SMART actions.

Two key teamwork skills that you consider weakness: Focus on the task and contributions

##Focus on the task
During the time working on the project, I found that I became easily distracted by refactoring current code instead on focusing on functionality. This meant that at some points during independent sessions, I focused on areas that worked fine instead of implementing new code. Later this meant that the game hadn't changed while hours of code had been changed.

In the industry, while working independently or in a group, it is critical to stay focused on the task as this could cost the project time and money. While refactoring code can improve software quality, a shippable product is prioirty. I found that while working in a group, Thomas improved my focus on the project which meant that progress was made during our pair programming sessions. Pair programming has been a useful method of maintaining focus as each person can keep the project on track.
