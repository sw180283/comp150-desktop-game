##Team Evaluation
(b) Write a draft 500-word report that must:
i. identify two key teamwork skills that you consider weaknesses;
ii. assess your application of each of these skills, describing how they
affected your work and suggesting why they arose;
iii. and then identify how to improve each of these skills, with reference
to SMART actions.

Two key teamwork skills that you consider weakness: Focus on the task and contributions

##Focus on the task
During the time working on the project, I found that I became easily distracted by re-factoring current code instead on focusing on functionality. This meant that at some points during independent sessions, I focused on areas that was functional instead of implementing new code. Later this meant that the game hadn't changed while hours of code had been changed.

In the industry, while working independently or in a group, it is critical to stay focused on the task as this could cost the project time and money. While re-factoring code can improve software quality, a shippable product is prioirty. I found that while working in a group, Thomas improved my focus on the project which meant that progress was made during our pair programming sessions. Pair programming has been a useful method of maintaining focus as each person can keep the project on track.

##How to improve skill
In order to improve this skill, I should aim to keep focus on the task by writing pseudo code that should guide the object of the programming session. In addition, "feature creep" should be avoided and only the basic code should be implemented in order to achieve the functionality of the pseudo code. I think that by writing a strict pseudo code before starting is an achievable action that could improve this skill. To measure this, I should be able to translate each line of code I have written at the end of a programming session to a line of pseudo code written before starting.

##Contribution
During my project, there were plenty of opportunities for the group project to be forgotten, as the number of other projects and deadlines interferred with regular contributions to Github. For many game studios, regular contribution and updating of the changelog are crucial to maintaining work flow. In addition, it keeps the rest of the group aware of the development of the project and not restricted by incomplete components of the game to work on other user stories.

##How to improve skill
In order to improve, I aim to make sure that I submit at least two Github commits per week, which should be relevant and commented appropriately. I think that this should improve my regularity of group contributions.
